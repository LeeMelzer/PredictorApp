# Machine Learning: Breast Cancer Predictor App
This is an application built to ***assist*** medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer from tissue samples. The app uses machine learning to predict whether a breast mass is benign or malignant based on measurements from a cytology lab. The app has been deployed using Streamlit and can be viewed live [here](https://predict-breast-cancer.streamlit.app). 

## Model Training
The dataset used for training can be found at the UCI Machine Learning Repository here: [DataSet](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic).

Tools used include:
  - JupyterLab
  - Pandas
  - Seaborn
  - SciKit-Learn

The model was found to have an accuracy of 98% (see image below).

## Future Versions
The current version has limited ability to receive input data. Plans for future versions prioritize user-friendly design and output. Streamlit is an excellent platform for launching simple applications quickly, however, more complex tools will likely be required for successful future updates.
